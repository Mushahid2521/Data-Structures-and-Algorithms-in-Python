## Algorithms

**Searching**
1. Binary Search: [Code](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/bianrySearch.py) 

**Sorting:** [Code](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/SrotingAlgorithms.py)

All the following Sorting algorithms have been implemented.
1. Insertion Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Buuble Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Counting Sort (something self made :wink:) 

**Backtracking**
