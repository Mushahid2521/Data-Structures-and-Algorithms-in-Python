# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python
In this repository different types of Data Structures and Algorithms have been implemented in Python. And solutions of different Problems based on these topics are also included.

## Data Structures

**Linked List:** [Code](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/linkedList.py)

**Queue using Linked List:** [Code](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/QueInLinkedlist.py)

**Stack:** [Code](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/stack.py), ```Solved Problems:``` [Paranthesis Balancing](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/parenthesisBalancing.py)

**Disjoint Set:** [Code](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/DisjointSet.py)

**Heap and Priority Que:** [Code](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/heap%26PrirotyQueue.py)

**Binary Search Tree using Linked List:** [Code](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/BinarySearchTree.py)

**Segment Tree:** [Code](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/SegmentTree.py), ```Solved Promlems:``` [Minimum value](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Problems/Segment_tree_minimumQuery.py)
## Algorithms

**Searching**
1. Binary Search: [Code](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/bianrySearch.py) 

**Sorting:** [Code](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/SrotingAlgorithms.py)

All the following Sorting algorithms have been implemented.
1. Insertion Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Buuble Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Counting Sort (something self made :wink:) 

**Backtracking**

```Solved Problems```: [Permutation Generator](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/permutationGeneratorBacktracking.py), [Cobmination Generator](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/conbinationGenerator.py), [NQuneens Problem](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Problems/nQueens.py)

### Graph-Theory

**BFS**: ```Code```: [code](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/bfs.py) ```Solved Problems```: [Depth of Nodes](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Problems/bfs_traversal.py)
