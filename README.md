# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python
In this repository different types of Data Structures and Algorithms have been implemented in Python. And solutions of different Problems based on these topics are also included.

## Data Structures

**Linked List**
[Implementation](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/linkedList.py)

**Que using Linked List**
[Implementation](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/QueInLinkedlist.py)

**Stack**

## Algorithms

**Searching**
1. Binary Search:
[Implementation](https://github.com/Mushahid2521/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/Algos/bianrySearch.py) 

**Sorting**
All the following Sorting algorithms have been implemented.
1. Insertion Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Buuble Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Counting Sort (something self made :wink:)
